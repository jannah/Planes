It had departed Zimbabwe on 2 March 1997 and arrived in Dublin, Ireland on 7 March 1997. It departed from Dublin at 21.15 hrs on 10 March 1997 and arrived at Shannon to refuel, prior to departure direct to Harare, Zimbabwe.The aircraft took off from runway 24 at Shannon Airport at 22:48 hrs. Because of the high weight the Captain used maximum Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) settings for this take-off. Immediately after take-off, at approximately 500 ft, the Captain was alerted to a fire in the No. 3 engine by audio and visual alarms. He continued to 1,000 ft, in order to gain safe altitude, whereupon he closed down No. 3 engine and initiated fire extinguishing drill. He discharged one fire-extinguishing bottle into the engine, waited 30 seconds and then discharged the second bottle. He was informed by personnel in the cabin that flames had been seen under No. 3 engine, but that they had then disappeared. The fire warning light remained illuminated, but the Captain was aware that fire damage to the detection harness could cause the warning light to remain on. He then commenced a circuit and proceeded to dump fuel as the aircraft had taken off at almost maximum gross weight and full fuel. While there were no visual indicators of continued fire in No. 3 engine, the fire warning light was still on, and he decided to dump fuel only from the opposite, left, side of the aircraft. He lowered the left fuel dump chute and proceeded to dump fuel. During this time the Captain assessed his landing options. The weather at Shannon Airport was deteriorating and there was a strong possibility that the airport would close shortly. Because of this, he did not have the option of loitering in the Shannon area to burn off fuel. Furthermore, because the B707 has only tank-to-engine cross-transfer, it was not possible to dump right wing fuel from the left wing dump chute. The Captain was concerned that if he dumped 30 tons of fuel from the left dump chute to bring the aircraft weight below the maximum landing weight, the aircraft would then be suffering a lateral imbalance of nearly 30 tons, with the added complication that only one engine was operative on the heavy (right) side. The Captain therefore decided to terminate the dumping after disposing of 10 tons of fuel and to land immediately thereafter at Shannon Airport. As he lined up for landing, at about 2,700 ft, he attempted to raise the left dump chute, which failed to retract. The Captain desired to raise the dump chute because deployment of the dump chute in the extended position would interfere with the selection of full flap. As the aircraft was still 30 tonnes above maximum landing weight of 112 tonnes, the Captain considered that he required full landing flap for landing in this condition. Because selection of full flap would result in damage to the extended dump chute, he elected to perform an overshoot in order to sort out the dump chute problem. After the over-shoot, a further attempt was made to retract the dump chute, and this was successful. During this phase of the flight, a fault also developed in the aircraft's Instrument Landing System (ILS) display.The Captain then commenced a second approach. When he selected undercarriage down, the green lights that indicate that the main wheels were lowered and locked down illuminated, but the green indicator for the nose wheel did not illuminate. He again elected to overshoot. Minimum altitude on this approach was 1,700 ft. He selected undercarriage up. The main undercarriage retracted but the nose did not.Noise under the cockpit indicated that the nose undercarriage doors were still open. The Captain then received ATC clearance to a holding area West of Shannon to consider the situation. He considered diverting to Gatwick, where Air Zimbabwe has a maintenance base, but Gatwick was subject to deteriorating weather and other airports such as Heathrow, Dublin and Cork were already closed due to poor visibility.Furthermore, there was continued concern regarding a possible deterioration of the weather at Shannon. When the aircraft was in the holding area, the undercarriage selection lever was moved, as normal, to the OFF position, having been previously on the UP position when the overshoot was initiated. The co-pilot then noticed that the nose green light had illuminated, indication that the nose wheel was now in the DOWN position. The flight engineer performed a visual inspection and confirmed that the nose undercarriage was down but not locked. When the undercarriage DOWN was then selected, the main wheel green lights also illuminated, and a visual inspection by the flight engineer confirmed that the nose undercarriage was now down and locked.The Captain then decided to return to Shannon. He set up a long 25-mile approach, and touched down smoothly, without any further problem. The Captain turned off the runway, and stopped while the attendant crash rescue service inspected the No. 3 engine for fire. Upon receiving a ""no fire"" report from the on-scene crash crews, the Captain decided against emergency evacuation of the aircraft. The aircraft then taxied to the terminal and the passengers disembarked normally."

The captain was an instructor, the copilot was receiving line training. The copilot was Pilot Flying (PF). While approaching Vilhena, the weather was reported below minima. Instead of diverting to the alternate airport, the captain decided they should execute an Echo 1 arrival procedure, which was an NDB approach to runway 03. Because actual weather at Vilhena had differed from reported weather conditions in the past, they would descend to MDA. If the runway was not in sight at that point, the approach would be aborted. The copilot inserted an MDA of 2500 feet in the Altitude Alert System. This was an error since the MDA was actually 2560 feet. Both pilot did not notice the error. The instructor told the copilot to monitor the artificial horizon during the final stages of the approach. The copilot focused on the artificial horizon and did not monitor the altimeter. The captain tried to obtain visual contact with the ground, but the city lights were off due to lack of electric energy. He did not call out the altitudes and the airplane did not level off at 2500 feet. The copilot probably shut off or silenced the Altitude Alert System and the airplane continued to descend below MDA. The airplane collided with various trees located to the right and one kilometre short of runway 03. It collided with the ground and skidded to a stop.

The FDR indicated that while the autopilot was engaged in the descent, the power levers moved from the mechanical autothrottle limit of 44 degrees to the manual limit of 37 degrees. As the aircraft leveled at 16,000 feet the airspeed decreased. The F/O began a right turn to enter a holding pattern and added some power, which stabilized the airspeed at 178 knots. However, the right bank and the resultant angle of attack (AOA) continued to increase, despite left aileron input by the autopilot. As the autopilot reached the maximum input of 20 degrees, bank angle increased past 50 degrees, and the AOA increased rapidly from 7 degrees to 12 degrees. At this point the stick shaker activated, the autopilot independently disconnected, the power was increased, and full left rudder was used to arrest the roll. The bank angle reached 56 degrees, and the AOA reached 13.7 degrees at 177 knots. The aircraft then pitched down, and entered a series of pitch, yaw, and roll maneuvers as the flight controls went through a period of oscillations for about 34 seconds. The maneuvers finally dampened and the crew recovered at approximately 13,000 feet. One passenger was seriously injured and one flight attendant received minor injuries during the upset. An analysis showed that the forces during the upset not only had gone above the design limit of the vertical stabilizer, they also apparently had reached the ultimate limit. In June 1997, Airbus requested that American Airlines perform another inspection of the jet to ensure it was not damaged. American inspectors, following Airbus' instructions, examined the tail fin. But they did not use methods that would have allowed them to see inside the tail fin. They saw no damage from their visual inspection, and the jet continued to fly until an ultrasound inspection of the horizontal stabilizer was done in March 2002. The inspection found two crescent-shaped cracks at one of the points where the tail fin attaches to the fuselage. The fin was replaced."

At approximately eight nautical miles from the airport the aircraft was clear of cloud and the crew could see the runway. In order to conduct some instrument approach practice, the pilot, who was also the company training pilot, placed a map against the co-pilot's windscreen to temporarily restrict his forward view outside the aircraft. The approach briefing was not amended to reflect the simulated instrument conditions for the approach. The co-pilot accurately flew the aircraft on the localizer to the FAF, at which point, he began to slow the aircraft to approximately 140 knots and requested that the pilot set ?�?� flap, which he did. Once past the FAF, the co-pilot's workload increased, and he had difficulty flying the simulated approach. On short final to runway 25, the pilot removed the map from the co-pilot's windscreen. The co-pilot noted that the aircraft was faster and higher than normal and he tried to regain the proper approach profile. By the time the aircraft reached the threshold of the runway 25, it was approximately 500 feet above ground, and at a relatively high speed, so the pilot took control of the aircraft for the landing. The pilot attempted to descend and slow the aircraft as it proceeded down the length of the runway and stated that he had just initiated an overshoot when he heard the first sounds of impact.

The crew's forward visibility was obscured, and the takeoff was aborted. The captain reported that the airplane drifted left into snow berms on the side of the 4200 feet long by 85 feet wide runway and caught fire. The ""DC-6 Airplane Operating Manual"" used by two other companies states ""...Certain combinations of temperature and humidity will cause moisture to condense from the air between the windshield panels and settle on the inner surfaces of the glass, obscuring vision. Once formed, anti-icing airflow with heater operation will be required to clear the panels."" This language was not included in the Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) literature, nor in the flight handbook for the company operating the accident airplane."
